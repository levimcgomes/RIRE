**VERY IMPORTANT!**
**This project isn't in a state where contributions are possible, as the backbone of the library hasn't yet been implemented. It's only open to the public at such an early state for anyone interested in reading the code to maybe gain some knowledge. As such, contributions won't probably be accepted, as I have a well defined idea of what's to be done. Thanks for reading.**

# Contributing to RIRE
